To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my interest in the UTS research into spinal cord injury recovery. It goes without saying this research could drastically improve the lives of people currently living with spinal cord injury and for those in the future that will also be affected. Spinal cord injury can affect anyone and currently there are no curative treatment options available.

Another great purpose I have seen this type of research perform is giving people hope. The necessary adjustment of life after a spinal cord injury is an enormous challenge to all involved. This program could lead to life-changing treatment options for spinal injuries. The hope for improvement carries over to all parts of life; whether it be work, rehab, or relationships.

This is why I have a personal interest in this research and see the urgent need to cure spinal cord injury. 

Thank you.</textarea
